SINGLE-CELL RNA-SEQ MALIGNANT CELL CLASSIFICATION REPORT
========================================================

Dataset Information:
- Total cells analyzed: 138,727
- Total genes: 2,920
- Number of clusters identified: 50

Malignancy Classification Results:
- Malignant cells identified: 60,425 (43.56%)
- Non-malignant cells: 78,302 (56.44%)

Cell Type Annotations:
- Unknown: 70,039 cells (50.49%)
- Unknown (Potentially Malignant): 22,157 cells (15.97%)
- Epithelial cell (Stress/Proliferative - Potentially Malignant): 13,110 cells (9.45%)
- T cell (Potentially Malignant): 9,877 cells (7.12%)
- Immune cell (Macrophage/Dendritic) (Potentially Malignant): 9,873 cells (7.12%)
- Epithelial cell: 8,263 cells (5.96%)
- Fibroblast (Potentially Malignant): 5,408 cells (3.90%)

Key Findings:
1. High proportion of potentially malignant cells (43.56%) suggests this is likely a cancer dataset
2. Major cell populations include:
   - Epithelial cells with stress/proliferative markers (potentially malignant)
   - T cells (some with malignancy markers)
   - Immune cells (macrophages/dendritic cells)
   - Fibroblasts
3. Cancer-associated genes detected in multiple clusters

Methodology:
- Quality control and preprocessing performed
- Leiden clustering (resolution=0.5) identified 50 clusters
- Cell type annotation based on marker gene expression
- Malignancy prediction based on:
  * Expression of COSMIC cancer genes
  * Stress/proliferation markers (DDIT4, HMGB2, NUPR1, STC2)
  * Metabolic stress indicators
